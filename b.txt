Remote repository operations:
------------------------------------

-->First we have to connect both local and remote repositories.

-->Before adding files to remote repo we have to create a new repo in remote repository, to do that we go to remote repository. Eg: github


1.  git remote add origin https://github.com/pranithchowdary19/project14.git

2. Origin is name of the remote repo.

3. To check added correctly or not we use--> git remote -v command.


4. The command for sending files from local repo to repo for the first time, we use
   Eg:-   git push -u origin master.
